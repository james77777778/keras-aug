KerasAug aims to provide fast and user-friendly preprocessing and augmentation layers, facilitating seamless integration with TensorFlow, Keras, and KerasCV.

KerasAug is:

- built entirely using TensorFlow, TensorFlow Probability, Keras and KerasCV
- supporting various data types, including images, bounding boxes, segmentation masks, and more.
- compatible with GPU (partially compatible with TPU/XLA)
- seamlessly integrating with the `tf.data` and `tf.keras.Model` API
- cosistent with officially published implementations
